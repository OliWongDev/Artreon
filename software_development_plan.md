# Software Development Plan -- Artreon

## Process:

### Trello Board Process

The plan was engineered to follow the Trello board in order of checkpoints in an agile fashion where flexibility and adapting to issues that arise are prioritized. This is done so that the developer could maintain adhering to the Trello board, and not throw it out the window when things change. This involved setting up a Trello Board into 4 main checkpoints to begin with:

1. Pre-Code Requirements
    - Setup Git Repo
    - Trello Board Setup
    - Software Development Plan Agreed
    - ERD Diagrams --> 4 part checklist
    - Research 3rd Party Services
    - Endpoint Foreshadowing
2. Code Requirements
    - Flask Initials (Hello World)
    - Code Itinerary --> 7 part checklist
    - Testing
3. Wrapping Up Application
    - Markdown Document Requirements --> 10 part checklist
4. Submission
    - Submit Assignment --> 2 part checklist

Each checkpoint would need to be fully complete before the developer could move onto the next in an ideal workflow.

"Would Be Nice":
    - Further, the developer added a "Would Be Nice" list to log helpful features/ideas that would be surplus to requirements, but would be fun or useful to implement to add to the application.

"In-Progress":
    - The developer's daily screenshots would indicate to the viewer what the developer was working on that day through the "In-Progress" list.

"Completed":
    - When subtasks were finished, they are moved to the "Completed" list.

The subtasks were given deadlines, descriptions, labels and activity updates from the developer.

### Deadlines

Each of the subtasks were given dates for the developer to aim to finish by. The end date of checkpoint 4 (Submission) was November 11, ideally giving the developer 3 days to adjust if things were taking longer than they had first anticipated. 

If the developer was able to finish all tasks before the deadlines, they would be able to move onto the "Would Be Nice" section to sugarcoat the application for the marker.

If the developer did not finish a task before the given deadline, this is seen as urgent. A red label (HIGH) would be put on that task if not already and it would be priorized above anything else. This is important as the flow of the project could be disrupted if this is not addressed promptly.

It is important to note that the developer aimed to not adjust the deadlines to the tasks where possible so as to try to keep the pace of project moving as expected.

### Descriptions

The developer added descriptions to each task that illustrated what the task was. 

This was done to give the developer clarity in the case that they forgot what a certain card meant or was having a mental block to start the task.

### Labels

The developer added labels to each task to indicate the priority within the checkpoint itself and/or the level of commitment required to complete this task. 

Red = High
    --> A high priority task that will likely take a high level of commitment

Yellow = Necessary
    --> A necessary task that will take a decent level of commitment to complete. Prioritized commitment after the red.

Green = Low
    --> Either a low priority task that is surplus/mildly helpful and takes little commitment. Unless procedural, this is least prioritized.

As mentioned previously, these labels could be adjusted depending on how the developer is tracking.

### Activity Statements

The developer added activity statements to subtasks to mark what progress they had done on the subtask at a certain point in time. 

The developer utilised these to signify what progress had been done on the task, whether it had been completed or not, contingency plans and notes that they thought up during the task. These are dated to mark when this statement was made.

## Trello Progress

To begin my Trello board process, I started very diligently but noticed that as the authorization issues hit me my progress and interest in the board waned thus causing a lack of consistentcy from 08/11 to 15/11. This is a point of emphasis for me to work on given that I am handing in an assignment late. Here are the screenshots from occassions where I was present and updating the board.
